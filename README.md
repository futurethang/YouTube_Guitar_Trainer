# YouTube_Guitar_Trainer - Chop Shop
A YouTube API web App for finding guitar lesson videos.

# Objectives
This app is meant to make it easy to jump online for a daily lesson, with minimal user parameter selection and focus on getting in and start playing quickly. 

The user can select a skill level, a genre, a format (exercise, lick, or song), a max video length, and add optional keywords to their search.

A submit button then returns a random video pick that meets the search terms without clearing the input fields.

Below the video are options to save the link, share, or load another video

# Robust Features
In addition to basic functionality, the app can ultimately include
* A user login to save their favorite videos, or integrate with their Google Login
* Ability to edit custom drop-downs for favorite genres or niche interest
* Some kind of Spotify integration with saved playlists generating how-to videos
* Links to useful guitar resources like Metronome, Tuner, tab search, etc.
* selecting different genres changes the background and page styles
* rating system so that bad videos don't come up again
